<h3>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? </h3>
<p>
There are a few core tenants of writing maintinable, readable, and adaptable code that I follow religiously. One such principle is extracting code blocks that become hard to read. While not found in this project, extracting a code block and replacing it with a simple to understand function such as "ProcessData()" ensures that developers in the future will be able to read and maintain code more easily. To keep my code adaptable, I try to make functions that can perform a variety of tasks. For instance, making one function that can be overloaded improves code readability and reusability. The more code is able to be adapted for a variety of uses, the easier it is to manage and read.

<h3>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?</h3>
<p>
As a computer scientist, I approach problems in a linear and progressive fashion. It is important to maintain a logical flow of thought while diagnosing and addressing problems, since emotions can run high when things don't go the way one would like. In the absence of compiler errors, I typically evaluate how a program is performing versus how I would like for it to perform and make educated guesses about what could be wrong in the source code to produce such a behavior. Once diagnosed, I work my way backwards in complexity, from simple mistakes such as syntax errors in output statements back to function calls and logic.

<h3>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?</h3>
<p>
Computer scientists combine principles of engineering, science, and mathematics to create, maintain, and improve software and hardware. As technology becomes increasingly complex and obtuse, it is important for individuals to stay up to date with new technology and the logic that drives it. Computer scientists work to maintain logical order in new and old technology in order for humans to continuously improve our tools in a way that is manageable for developers of the future.
